## 比较操作大小写敏感



> Comparisons are **case insensitive** when the column uses a collation which ends with `_ci` (such as the *default* `latin1_general_ci` collation) and they are **case sensitive** when the column uses a collation which ends with `_cs` or `_bin` (such as the `utf8_unicode_cs` and `utf8_bin` collations). ^[1]^
