## Fixed-Point Types



> The `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC` types store exact numeric data values. These types are used when it is important to preserve exact precision, for example with monetary data. In MySQL, `NUMERIC` is implemented as `DECIMAL`, so the following remarks about `DECIMAL` apply equally to `NUMERIC`.
>
> MySQL stores `DECIMAL` values in ==binary format==. See [Section 12.25, “Precision Math”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/precision-math.html).
>
> In a `DECIMAL` column declaration, the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified. For example:
>
> ```sql
> salary DECIMAL(5,2)
> ```
>
> In this example, `5` is the precision and `2` is the scale. ==The precision represents the number of significant digits that are stored for values, and the scale represents the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point.==
>
> Standard SQL requires that `DECIMAL(5,2)` be able to store any value with five digits and two decimals, so values that can be stored in the `salary` column range from `-999.99` to `999.99`.
>
> In standard SQL, the syntax `DECIMAL(*`M`*)` is equivalent to `DECIMAL(*`M`*,0)`. Similarly, the syntax `DECIMAL` is equivalent to `DECIMAL(*`M`*,0)`, where the implementation is permitted to decide the value of *`M`*. MySQL supports both of these variant forms of `DECIMAL` syntax. The default value of *`M`* is 10.
>
> If the scale is 0, `DECIMAL` values contain no decimal point or fractional part.
>
> The maximum number of digits for `DECIMAL` is 65, but the actual range for a given `DECIMAL` column can be constrained by the precision or scale for a given column. ==When such a column is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than are permitted by the specified scale, the value is converted to that scale.== (The precise behavior is operating system-specific, but generally the effect is truncation to the permissible number of digits.) ^[1]^
