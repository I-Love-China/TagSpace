### What

> This is an HTTP Proxy (aka gateway) in the form of a Java servlet. An HTTP proxy is useful for AJAX applications to communicate with web accessible services on hosts other than where the web application is hosted. It's a *reverse proxy*, and not really a *forwarding proxy* albeit the template form of the servlet may blur that line.
