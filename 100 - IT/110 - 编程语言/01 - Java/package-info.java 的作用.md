## package-info.java



### 作用

1. **A place for package-level documentation ^[1]^**

   > Prior to Java version 5, the documentation related to a package was placed in an HTML file, *package.html*. This is just a normal HTML file with Javadoc comments placed inside the *body* tag.
   >
   > 
   >
   > As **JDK 5** arrived on the scene, *package.html* gave way to a new option, *package-info.java*,** which is now preferred over *package.html*.


2. **Home for package-level annotations ^[1]^**

   > Suppose we have to **apply an annotation to the entire package**. In this case, *package-info.java* can come to our aid. ^[1]^
