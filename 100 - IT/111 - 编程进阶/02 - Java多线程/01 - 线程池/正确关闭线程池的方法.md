## 正确关闭线程池的方法

### 目标

等待线程池执行完所有已提交的任务之后，关闭线程池，以释放线程池占用的资源

>  An unused `ExecutorService` should be shut down to allow reclamation of its resources. ^[2]^



### 背景 & 前提

> To make the shutdown graceful, you need to catch the interrupted exception in the threads or check the interrupted status. ^[1]^
>
> This is because the interruption of threads in Java is a ==collaborative process== (i.e. the **interrupted** code must do something when asked to stop, not the **interrupting** code). ^[1]^

> When calling `shutdownNow`, the executor will (generally) try to interrupt the threads that it manages. ^[1]^

Runnable 任务逻辑中需要捕获 InterruptedException，或检查 interrupted 状态，因为线程池的关闭实际上是向其中的 Worker 发送 interrupted 信号



### 相关 API

#### `shutdown()`

> The `shutdown()` method will ==allow previously submitted tasks== to execute before terminate. ^[2]^



#### `shutdownNow()`

> The `shutdownNow()` method ==prevents waiting tasks from starting== and attempts to stop currently executing tasks. ^[2]^



#### `awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`

> ==Blocks== until : ^[2]^
>
> 1. all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, 
>
> 2. or the timeout occurs, 
>
> 3. or the current thread is interrupted,
>
>    whichever happens first (以先发生者为准).



#### `isTerminated()`

> Returns `true` if all tasks have completed following shut down. ^[2]^



### 关闭方法 ^[1][2]^

```java
// 这里分为两阶段来关闭: 第一阶段拒绝接受新任务；第二阶段会放弃队列中未开始的任务。所以实际等待的时间是 2 * 60s
// 注意: 可能任务不会全部执行完！！！
/* Guava 工具类方法:
   MoreExecutors.shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService service, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) 
*/

executorService.shutdown();

try {
    // wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
    if(!executorService.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        executorService.shutdownNow();  // cancel currently executing tasks
        
        if(!executorService.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            System.out.println("Pool did not terminate");
        }
    }
} catch(InterruptedException ie) {
    // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
    executorService.shutdownNow();
    
    Thread.currentThread.interrupt();
}
```
